Meru Regional Government hospital in Arusha, Tanzania. The population served is primarily the poor and marginalized people in the Arusha area, through direct psychiatric and psychological service provision.<br \/>\nMental health concerns are prevalent in this country and mental health service provision is rare and laden with taboo, not specifically or adequately budgeted for, or invisible to those needing service. AMHT works to provide mental health service in an integrated model within the government hospital, as part of government policy, and within World Health Organization guidelines.&#8221; (AMHT information page).<br \/>\nWith this program, Juma is now even more qualified to address the difficult circumstances and complex needs of former street youths and children. Many of our kids have gone through rough times, growing up without even food, suffering abuse, or missing their parents. Such issues need a lot of love, patience and training to help heal. Juma is dedicated to supporting these kids holistically.
