These neat shirts serve two purposes: they help us spread the world about Amani, and they help up support Amani. Half the profits of each shirt help with the food and housing costs for Amani&#8217;s 30 resident children. That shirt you buy transforms itself into full bullies, healthier bodies, a good day at school and water to quench a child&#8217;s thirst. Amani runs solely on donations, so fundraisers like this ARE the only way such daily necessities become realities.<br \/>\nWhat is twenty dollars to you? A dinner meal? A movie and popcorn? A parking ticket? Do something meaningful with that fraction of your next paycheck! You get a shirt, and these children know that across the world, people care.<br \/>\nSupport us and find more information at our<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/childrenofamani\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Fundraiser Facebook Page<\/a>, or purchase a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.booster.com\/amani\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">shirt here<\/a>!<br \/>\n<strong>FUNDRAISER ENDS SEPTEMBER 9TH!\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Think of the last t-shirt you purchased.
