Our tour director was Seif Mohamed. Seif asked the group on the tour if they would like to visit an orphanage and all agreed to do so.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">While there, we met Amiri Adamu and others. While taking a tour of the then-current facilities, I noticed a large black water tank laying on the ground and that caused an inquiry. We had see \u00a0the new showers and toilets, but were told they did not have water. Also, we were told that they did not have the funds to erect the water tank on a tower so that the water from the tank could be piped into the toilets, showers and wash basins.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Upon getting home, I worked with Seif Mohamed &amp; Amiri Adumu to get an estimate for the cost to build a tower, erect the tank on the tower and pipe water into the showers, toilets and wash basins. That began our more deep involvement with Amani Orphanage. This first project raised money from a number of people in our community and church to buy the materials for erecting the tower, placing the tank on the tower and piping the water to the showers, toilets and wash basins.<img decoding=\"async\" class=\" size-full wp-image-747 aligncenter lazyload\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-src=\"https:\/\/childrenofamani.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/screen-shot-2016-03-14-at-22-34-44-pm.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2016-03-14 at 22.34.44 PM\" width=\"435\" height=\"478\" \/><noscript><img decoding=\"async\" class=\" size-full wp-image-747 aligncenter lazyload\" src=\"https:\/\/childrenofamani.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/screen-shot-2016-03-14-at-22-34-44-pm.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2016-03-14 at 22.34.44 PM\" width=\"435\" height=\"478\" \/><\/noscript><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Another project helped to purchase a number of metal beds with mattresses.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-750 lazyload\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-src=\"https:\/\/childrenofamani.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/screen-shot-2016-03-14-at-22-36-02-pm.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2016-03-14 at 22.36.02 PM.png\" width=\"527\" height=\"207\" \/><noscript><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-750 lazyload\" src=\"https:\/\/childrenofamani.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/screen-shot-2016-03-14-at-22-36-02-pm.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2016-03-14 at 22.36.02 PM.png\" width=\"527\" height=\"207\" \/><\/noscript><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">One of the key projects that came next was the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153canal\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and dry well to dispose of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dirty water\u00e2\u20ac\u009d.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\" size-full wp-image-752 aligncenter lazyload\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-src=\"https:\/\/childrenofamani.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/screen-shot-2016-03-14-at-22-37-26-pm.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2016-03-14 at 22.37.26 PM.png\" width=\"512\" height=\"520\" \/><noscript><img decoding=\"async\" class=\" size-full wp-image-752 aligncenter lazyload\" src=\"https:\/\/childrenofamani.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/screen-shot-2016-03-14-at-22-37-26-pm.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2016-03-14 at 22.37.26 PM.png\" width=\"512\" height=\"520\" \/><\/noscript><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Another project that was water related was the purchase and installation of a pump motor to bring water from the community well to the water tank.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\" size-full wp-image-755 aligncenter lazyload\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-src=\"https:\/\/childrenofamani.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/screen-shot-2016-03-14-at-22-43-10-pm1.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2016-03-14 at 22.43.10 PM.png\" width=\"538\" height=\"370\" \/><noscript><img decoding=\"async\" class=\" size-full wp-image-755 aligncenter lazyload\" src=\"https:\/\/childrenofamani.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/screen-shot-2016-03-14-at-22-43-10-pm1.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2016-03-14 at 22.43.10 PM.png\" width=\"538\" height=\"370\" \/><\/noscript><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Upon making a photographic presentation at our Church which included pictures of the orphanage, one of the ladies in charge of the Knitting Group suggested that they could make knitted blankets for each of the 38 kids in the orphanage.
